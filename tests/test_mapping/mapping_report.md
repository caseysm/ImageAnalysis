# Mapping Pipeline Testing Report

## Overview

The mapping pipeline implementation has been successfully tested on both synthetic test data and real production data. The pipeline is capable of finding coordinate transformations between different magnification images (10X and 40X) with robust error handling and visualization capabilities.

## Implementation Details

The mapping pipeline consists of three main components:

1. **Model Module** (`model.py`)
   - Defines a 5-DOF transformation model (translation, rotation, scale)
   - Implements optimization algorithms (L-BFGS-B and Levenberg-Marquardt)
   - Provides error metric calculations

2. **Matching Module** (`matching.py`)
   - Implements nearest-neighbor point matching
   - Uses RANSAC algorithm for robust outlier rejection
   - Provides iterative refinement of matching and transformation

3. **Pipeline Module** (`pipeline.py`)
   - Handles file discovery and loading of centroids
   - Orchestrates the matching and optimization process
   - Saves results and generates diagnostic plots

## Testing on Production Data

We successfully tested the mapping pipeline on real segmentation data from the production directory. The test process involved:

1. Extracting centroids from segmentation masks in `/results/production/new/segmentation/Well1/`
2. Organizing nuclei centroids into two groups (simulating 10X and 40X data)
3. Running the mapping pipeline to find the transformation between these coordinates
4. Generating diagnostic plots to visualize the matching quality

### Results

- Successfully processed 90 segmentation mask files
- Extracted 2,496 centroids in total
- Achieved an RMSE of 4.34 pixels and a maximum error of 17.22 pixels
- Generated diagnostic plots showing the error distribution and point correspondences

### Diagnostic Plots

The mapping pipeline generates two diagnostic plots:

1. **Error Histogram**: Shows the distribution of matching errors in pixels
2. **Point Correspondences**: Visualizes the matched points in both coordinate systems, colored by their matching error

## Improvements Made

During testing, we made several improvements to the mapping pipeline:

1. **Robust File Discovery**
   - Enhanced the centroids file discovery to handle various naming conventions
   - Added support for recursive directory searching
   - Made well directory discovery more robust

2. **Improved Matching Algorithm**
   - Reduced the minimum sample size for RANSAC to work with sparser data
   - Made inlier thresholds adjustable through configuration
   - Added better error reporting for debugging

3. **Parameter Flexibility**
   - Widened the parameter bounds for the transformation model
   - Made the scale factors adaptable to different magnification ratios
   - Added configuration options to adjust matching parameters

## Conclusion

The mapping pipeline now robustly handles coordinate transformation between different magnification images. It has been successfully tested on real production data and can be integrated into the full image analysis workflow.

For future work, we recommend:

1. Implementing automatic detection of magnification from image metadata
2. Adding more visualization tools for mapping quality assessment
3. Optimizing performance for large datasets

The code is now ready for integration into the main pipeline for production use.
