# Parallelism Improvements for Benchmark Script

## Summary of Enhancements

The benchmark script has been enhanced with comprehensive parallelism to fully utilize all available CPU cores:

1. **Concurrent Segmentation Processing**
   - All 10x and 40x image segmentation tasks run in parallel
   - Uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` with optimal number of workers (CPU count - 1)
   - Tasks submitted with `executor.submit()` for maximum flexibility
   - Results collected as they complete

2. **Parallel Benchmark Trials**
   - Multiple optimization trials run concurrently
   - Each trial compares L-BFGS-B and LMA independently
   - Dynamic worker allocation based on available cores and trial count

3. **Environment Optimizations**
   - Numerical libraries (OpenBLAS, MKL, OMP) configured to use all cores
   - Enhanced Python multiprocessing settings
   - Increased file descriptor limits for parallel execution
   - Process sleeping prevention with `caffeinate`

4. **Temporary Directory Management**
   - Process-specific temporary directories to avoid conflicts
   - Includes timestamp and PID for uniqueness
   - Proper cleanup in finally block

5. **Real-time Performance Monitoring**
   - Concurrent monitoring of CPU utilization
   - Polls process and system metrics every 30 seconds
   - Detailed logging of performance metrics

6. **Improved Logging and Reporting**
   - System information captured at startup
   - Progress reporting for individual segmentation tasks
   - Total execution time tracking and formatted reporting
   - All outputs saved to timestamped log file

## Performance Expectations

On the 12-core system detected, you should see:
- Near 1100% CPU utilization during parallel segmentation (leaving one core free for system processes)
- Additional speedup from vectorized numerical operations with optimized library settings
- Significant reduction in total runtime compared to sequential execution

## Running the Enhanced Benchmark

```bash
./run_benchmark_realdata.sh
```

This will execute the benchmark with all parallelism enhancements enabled, utilizing all available CPU cores on your system. Monitor the real-time output to see CPU utilization during execution.

## Next Steps

1. Run the benchmark and analyze the results
2. Compare the performance between L-BFGS-B and LMA optimization methods
3. Review the logs for any bottlenecks in parallel execution
4. Consider further optimizations based on the observed performance profile
