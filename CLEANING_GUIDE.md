# Project Cleanup Guide

This document explains the cleanup and reorganization process performed on the ImageAnalysis project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Structure Reorganization

- Created a proper Python package structure in `imageanalysis/`
- Migrated all modules from the root directory to the package
- Updated import statements to use absolute paths
- Added proper `__init__.py` files with component exports

### 2. Documentation Improvements

- Updated README.md with comprehensive usage examples
- Created documentation files:
  - INSTALLATION.md - Detailed installation instructions
  - MIGRATION_GUIDE.md - Guide for migrating code to new structure
  - PACKAGE_STRUCTURE.md - Explanation of the package organization
  - CHANGELOG.md - Record of project changes

### 3. Script and Tool Migration

- Migrated command-line scripts to `imageanalysis/bin/`
- Configured entry points in setup.py for direct command usage
- Ensured all scripts use consistent argument handling

### 4. Original Code Preservation

- Kept original pipeline scripts in `original_pipeline/` directory for reference
- Maintained functional equivalence with original implementation

### 5. Testing Framework

- Organized test scripts in the `tests/` directory
- Created test categories:
  - Basic tests for fundamental functionality
  - Synthetic tests with generated data
  - Full pipeline tests with real data
- Added test_package.py script for verifying installation

## Directory Structure Evolution

### Before Cleanup

```
ImageAnalysis/
├── bin/               # Command-line scripts (direct access)
├── core/              # Core functionality (direct import)
├── utils/             # Utility functions (direct import)
├── tests/             # Tests (direct import)
└── original_pipeline/ # Original scripts
```

### After Cleanup

```
ImageAnalysis/
├── imageanalysis/     # Main package directory
│   ├── bin/           # Command-line scripts
│   ├── core/          # Core functionality 
│   ├── utils/         # Utility functions
│   └── config/        # Configuration
├── original_pipeline/ # Original scripts (preserved)
├── tests/             # Test suite
├── setup.py           # Package installation
└── documentation      # Documentation files
```

## Installation and Usage

The package can now be installed and used in two ways:

1. **As a Python package:**
   ```python
   import imageanalysis
   from imageanalysis.core.segmentation import Segmentation10XPipeline
   ```

2. **As command-line tools:**
   ```bash
   run-segmentation input.nd2 --magnification 10x
   run-genotyping input.nd2 --segmentation-dir results/segmentation
   ```

## Testing Your Installation

To verify your installation is correct:

```bash
python test_package.py
```

This script will check that all components can be imported correctly.

## Future Maintenance

When adding new functionality:

1. Place code in the appropriate module within the `imageanalysis/` package
2. Update imports to use absolute paths (e.g., `from imageanalysis.core`)
3. Add tests to the `tests/` directory
4. Update documentation as needed
