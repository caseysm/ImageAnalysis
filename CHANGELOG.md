## [1.0.0] - 2024

### Added
- New modular package structure with clear separation of concerns
- Base `Pipeline` class for standardizing pipeline implementations
- Comprehensive CLI interface for running all pipeline components
- Centralized configuration management in `config/settings.py`
- Type hints and input validation throughout the codebase
- Unit testing framework with sample test data
- Parallel processing capabilities via `BatchProcessor` class
- Logging system with both file and console handlers
- Documentation including README, contribution guidelines, and API docs

### Changed
- Completely refactored codebase from monolithic scripts to modular package
- Reorganized core functionality into specialized modules:
  - `core/segmentation/` for cell segmentation
  - `core/genotyping/` for barcode analysis
  - `core/phenotyping/` for cell phenotype analysis
  - `core/visualization/` for plotting and album generation
- Consolidated redundant implementations:
  - Combined multiple barcode choosing methods into single robust implementation
  - Unified image loading and processing utilities
  - Standardized error handling and logging
- Improved configuration management:
  - Moved from hardcoded values to centralized settings
  - Added JSON configuration support
  - Implemented configuration validation
- Enhanced visualization capabilities:
  - Better album generation with more options
  - Improved quality control plots
  - Standardized plotting functions

### Removed
- Deprecated functions and duplicate implementations:
  - `Choose_Barcodes_V1` and `Choose_Barcodes_V2` (consolidated into improved version)
  - Redundant image loading functions
  - Unused utility functions
- Legacy script-based workflow in favor of modular approach
- Hardcoded configuration values
- Global state dependencies

### Fixed
- Inconsistent error handling across functions
- Memory inefficiencies in image processing
- Redundant data loading and processing
- Unclear function interfaces and documentation
- Lack of type safety in critical functions
- Missing input validation in key components

### Technical Details
- Reduced total codebase size from ~4,900 to ~3,335 lines while maintaining functionality
- Improved code organization with clear module boundaries
- Added proper package management and dependency handling
- Implemented consistent coding style and documentation
- Added automated testing and validation

### Migration Guide
Users of the previous version should:
1. Update their configuration files to use the new JSON format
2. Replace direct script calls with CLI commands
3. Update any custom implementations to use the new module structure
4. Review the new configuration options in `config/settings.py`
5. Update their pipeline workflows to use the new standardized interfaces

### Dependencies
- Added proper version management for all dependencies
- Updated to modern Python package structure
- Introduced new testing and development dependencies
